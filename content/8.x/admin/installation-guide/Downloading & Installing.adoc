== Downloading and installing SuiteCRM
If you are installing SuiteCRM for the first time, follow the instructions in this section. If you have an earlier version of SuiteCRM installed, refer to the upgrade section for instructions on how to upgrade your SuiteCRM instance. Follow the steps listed below to install SuiteCRM:

=== Downloading the latest SuiteCRM files
. Install the platform-appropriate version of PHP, web server, and database on your machine.
. Download the SuiteCRM files from suitecrm.com (see "Downloading the latest SuiteCRM files" section).
. Copy the SuiteCRM files to your web server.

=== Installation pre-requisites

See the link:/8.x/admin/compatibility-matrix/[Compatibility matrix] to ensure you have the correct versions of the required softwares.

{{% notice note %}}
Some of the dependencies in the above link are only required when setting up a development environment.
  When installing SuiteCRM from a package zip you **do not** need to install the dependencies that are for development, namely: node, angular cli, yarn/npm
  The reason being that SuiteCRM 8 package zip comes with the pre-built front end files under `public/dist`

{{% notice note %}}
Please make sure that your `apache` has `mod_rewrite` enabled and that it is properly configured to allow for re-writes.
  All SuiteCRM-Core api calls depend on this (calls to `api/graphql`) if re-rewrites are not allowed you will get a `404` when calling the api.

=== Preparing and installing SuiteCRM files to a web server
. Locate the directory on the webserver in which the SuiteCRM directory will be located (most commonly the root directory or within a subdirectory).
. Unzip the SuiteCRM zip file contents to your destination directory.
. Set the required permissions to continue with the install as follows;
+
[source,bash]
----
find . -type d -not -perm 2775 -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
find . -type f -not -perm 0644 -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
find . ! -user www-data -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;
chmod +x bin/console
----
* That `www-data` needs to be replaced by the actual system user that your webserver runs under. This varies depending on your
operating system. Common web server users are as follows:
** `www-data` (Ubuntu Linux/Apache)
** `apache` (Linux/Apache)
** `nobody` (Linux/Apache)
** `IUSR_computerName` (Windows/IIS)
